# Project Manager

This is a personal project to build a bug tracking application with **React.js** and **Spring Boot** with a **MySQL** Database.

* All data is stored within a SQL Database that has a table for cards and a table for user info. As I learn more about SQL this will likely see an overhaul to be more dynamic.

* Most work at the moment is being done on the login page to allow multiple users to each have their own boards. when a user logs in they will be able to select one of the boards they have assigned to their data and all cards assigned to that board will be loaded.


## Main Page

* This is where Boards can be accessed. The board has 3 categories that will contain cards that belong to it. 
* Cards can be clicked to reveal more information about it below the categories. In the future this will hover over to draw focus towards the desired information.
